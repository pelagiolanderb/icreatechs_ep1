During this assignment, I gained knowledge about various HTML elements and how to create HTML forms to collect user input effectively. This understanding allowed me to build interactive forms that enabled people to enter data smoothly. Additionally, I learned about form validation, which ensured that the submitted data was accurate and met the specified criteria. Moreover, I explored CSS styling techniques that enhanced the visual appeal of the forms, creating a more pleasant user experience overall. The combination of these skills empowered me to develop functional and aesthetically pleasing web forms, improving the overall usability of the project.
